<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This dish is a German recipe, consisting of potato, bacon, and egg. However, bratkartoffeln translates to <em>'Fried Potatoes'</em>, and whatever else you add to it is personal preference. My preference is bacon and egg.</p>
<ul>
    <li>6 large potatoes</li>
    <li>4 Large Eggs</li>
    <li>250g Bacon</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to prepare and cook this recipe</h3>
<ol>
    <li>First, dice the potatoes into small cubes. Once diced, add to water, and bring to the boil and boil until tender</li>
    <li>Chop the bacon up into small pieces. Fry the pieces in a little oil, with added seasoning until crispy.</li>
    <li>Crack the eggs into a container and whisk them until mixed fully. Add salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Once the potatoes are cooked, add them to a large pan with some oil, and fry on a high heat to brown them.</li>
    <li>When the potatoes are browned, add the eggs and bacon together, and continue cooking, while constantly stirring the mixture to ensure the eggs are cooked evenly. When the eggs are cooked sufficiently (I prefer them to be cooked still kind of runny), turn it off the heat, and it's ready to serve!</li>
